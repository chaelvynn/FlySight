                            "Hi! I'm Sessario Ammar Wibowo, a 5th-semester computer science student at Bina Nusantara University, aspiring to be a software engineer. I'm passionate about enhancing my full-stack skills and applying them to real-world projects. As an active member of BNEC and the president of BNEC Bandung, I enjoy developing leadership and talent.
                        <p>
                            With experience in Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and C, Iâ€™ve worked on projects like a Tkinter-based face recognition GUI for a DJI Tello Drone and a Flask web app deploying a deep learning model. I'm excited to collaborate and keep learning!"

                        <p>This web-app deploys a deep learning model to predict respiratory sickness through the breathing sound of the clients by analyzing wheezes and crackles pattern</p>
                        <p>This was a group project and class assignment, my role was both front-end and back-end in developing the app. I developed the deep-learning model, integrated all of the html pages, dealt with the backend, and cleaned the designs so they are in unison and work accordingly</p>
                        <P>From this project, i have learned how to deploy deep-learning model locally, how important it is to have the whole team understand the stack used, and how much learning a new framework can teach you</P>
                        <p>Tech Stack: Flask, Python, Javascript, Bootstrap, MySQL</p>

                        <p>This was a self initiated group project for a competition, i played the role of the backend, where i dealt with making the simple machine learning model and the core functionality of the program</p>
                        <P>From this project, i have learned how important it is to learn git, we finished this project without using git so there are some technical issues. I also learned how important it is that, regardless of your role, you need to understand both backend and frontend to an extent</P>

                        <p>This was a self initiated group project, a team that represents Binus in the national competition KRTI in the TD division. I played the role of integration and core functionality. I developed manual controls, GUI Tinker design, the function that the camera uses to approximate the distance and also to follow the target autonomously. Additionally, aside from integrating the face recognition model, I applied multi threading to the program to enhance performance.</p>
                        <P>From this project, I learned how to increase efficiency in python programs, dealing with multi-threading and a lot more methods. And I learned how drone works and a deeper undertanding of how advanced face recognition algorithm works</P>
