                <h2>FlySight</h2>
                <p>FlySight is an Artificial Intelligence-based drone system designed to follow a person according to a pre-set target, combining two key components: the drone and the Ground Control System (GCS). The GCS stores facial data necessary for face detection, allowing the drone to recognize and track individuals.</p>
                <p>This technology can be used for both security and entertainment purposes. In the entertainment industry, FlySight excels in capturing dynamic shots in dangerous or challenging environments, such as filming action scenes where synchronized movement between the actor and camera is crucial.</p>
                <p>FlySight automates drone control, enhancing safety, efficiency, and accuracy, particularly in fast-paced environments like film production or live events. The system processes data from onboard sensors, including cameras, through the GCS, which then adjusts the drone's position to maintain a safe and precise distance from detected objects, such as people or vehicles.</p>

                        <h2>Preparation and Initial Setup:</h2>
                        <p>Drone Readiness: Ensure that the drone is fully charged and all components, including the camera, sensors, and communication systems, are securely attached and functioning correctly. Conduct a thorough inspection of all hardware to prevent any operational issues during the flight.</p>
                        <p>Connection to Ground Control Station (GCS): Connect the drone to the Ground Control Station via a Wi-Fi signal. This connection is essential for transmitting data between the drone and the GCS.</p>
                        <p>Software Verification: The operator must check the connection status and ensure that the GCS software is up and running, ready to receive data from the drone. This includes verifying that the user interface displays the correct flight parameters and settings.</p>
                        <p>Calibration: Perform necessary calibrations for the sensors and camera to ensure accurate data collection during flight. This may include compass calibration, gyroscope calibration, and testing the camera's focus and angles.</p>

                        <h2>Operation and Flight:</h2>
                        <p>Flight Initiation: Once all preparations are completed and verified, the operator can initiate the flight by sending commands from the GCS. The drone will take off and begin its predefined flight path.</p>
                        <p>Data Collection: During the flight, the drone will collect data from the surrounding environment using its onboard sensors and cameras. This may include environmental conditions, images, and video footage.</p>
                        <p>Object Detection and Positioning: As the drone flies, it will automatically detect nearby objects through its sensors. The system will process this information in real-time to adjust the drone's position accordingly, maintaining a safe distance from detected objects, such as people, vehicles, or obstacles.</p>
                        <p>Dynamic Flight Adjustments: The drone's flight path may be dynamically altered based on real-time data analysis to enhance safety and effectiveness. This ensures optimal performance in varying conditions and environments.</p>

                        <h2>Monitoring and Data Analysis:</h2>
                        <p>Real-Time Monitoring: The operator can monitor real-time data displayed on the GCS screen, including live video feeds, telemetry information, and critical flight parameters such as altitude, speed, and battery status.</p>
                        <p>Data Analysis: Based on the incoming data, the operator can perform analysis to assess the drone's performance and the environment it is navigating. This may involve identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, or ensuring that the mission objectives are being met.</p>
                        <p>Decision-Making: Utilizing the data received, the operator can make informed decisions, such as changing the flight path to avoid obstacles, re-routing the drone to explore different areas, or instructing the drone to approach or move away from specific objects based on the mission requirements.</p>
                        <p>Post-Flight Review: After the flight, data collected during the mission can be reviewed and analyzed for further insights. This information can inform future missions and improve operational strategies.</p>
